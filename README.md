## Summary Solver
### A solver for the web game Summary


#### Frontend: Svelte
#### Backend: static file serving, AWS s3

#### Major Functions: Can solve any combination for the game Summary, Will tell you if there is no solution possible for the current combination

#### Reason for Creation: I saw a tweet by Rich Harris the creator of svelte that he liked this game called Summary. I tried to solve it for like 30 minutes and got frustrated so i created a python script to solve it. Then I decied to make an overkill frontend for it in svelte 5 because I wanted to learn about it anyway.

#### Potential monetization model: no monetization, page ads, links to other word/number games.

#### Market Size: All the people who aren't good at Summary
